## [2.0.3] - 2025-08-06

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Static Init Method Access
- **FIX**: Added static `NotificationKit.init()` method for easier initialization
- Users can now use `NotificationKit.init(config)` directly without calling `getInstance()` first
- Both patterns are now supported:
  - `NotificationKit.init(config)` (recommended)
  - `NotificationKit.getInstance().init(config)` (alternative)

### üìö Documentation
- Added React + Capacitor example app in `examples/react-capacitor-example`
- Updated API documentation to reflect static init method
- Added example app reference in main README

## [2.0.0] - 2024-08-02

### üöÄ Major Release - Zero Dependencies Architecture

This is a major release that introduces a revolutionary zero-dependency architecture, making notification-kit the most lightweight notification library for React and Capacitor apps.

### üí• Breaking Changes

#### Zero Runtime Dependencies
- **BREAKING**: All dependencies moved to optional peer dependencies
- **BREAKING**: Dependencies are now dynamically imported only when needed
- Users must install provider SDKs separately when using specific features:
  - Firebase: `npm install firebase`
  - OneSignal: `npm install react-onesignal`
  - Capacitor: `npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/push-notifications @capacitor/local-notifications`
  - React Hooks: `npm install react react-dom`

#### API Changes
- **BREAKING**: React exports removed from main entry point to prevent circular dependencies
- React hooks now imported from `notification-kit/react` instead of `notification-kit`
- All Capacitor and provider imports are now dynamic and lazy-loaded

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Zero-Dependency Architecture
- Core library has **zero runtime dependencies**
- In-app notifications work immediately without any dependencies
- Graceful degradation when optional dependencies are missing
- Clear, helpful error messages guide users to install only what they need

#### Provider-less Design
- No React providers or wrappers required
- Works in dynamically injected components
- Singleton pattern for global state management
- Direct API usage without context providers

#### Dynamic Loading
- All dependencies loaded on-demand using dynamic imports
- Automatic platform detection without importing Capacitor
- Reduced initial bundle size
- Tree-shaking friendly architecture

### üîß Improvements

#### Developer Experience
- Clearer installation instructions with optional dependencies
- Better error messages with installation guidance
- Simplified API without provider requirements
- TypeScript types still fully supported

#### Performance
- Smaller initial bundle size
- Faster load times with lazy loading
- Only loads code for features actually used
- Optimized build outputs

#### Documentation
- Updated README with zero-dependency approach
- Clear separation of core vs optional features
- Migration guide for v1.x users
- Examples for progressive enhancement

### üîÑ Migration Guide

#### From v1.x to v2.0.0

1. **Update imports for React hooks:**
   ```typescript
   // Before (v1.x)
   import { useNotifications } from 'notification-kit'
   
   // After (v2.0.0)
   import { useNotifications } from 'notification-kit/react'
   ```

2. **Install dependencies as needed:**
   ```bash
   # Basic installation (zero dependencies)
   npm install notification-kit
   
   # Add dependencies only for features you use:
   npm install firebase              # For Firebase provider
   npm install react-onesignal       # For OneSignal provider
   npm install @capacitor/core       # For Capacitor features
   npm install react react-dom       # For React hooks
   ```

3. **No provider setup required:**
   ```typescript
   // Before (v1.x) - Provider required
   <NotificationProvider>
     <App />
   </NotificationProvider>
   
   // After (v2.0.0) - No provider needed!
   // Just initialize once:
   NotificationKit.init({ provider: 'firebase', config: {...} })
   // Then use anywhere:
   notifications.show({ title: 'Hello!' })
   ```

### üì¶ Bundle Size Improvements

- Core library: ~6KB (gzipped)
- With Firebase: +12KB only when used
- With OneSignal: +14KB only when used
- In-app notifications: Works with 0 additional dependencies

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed circular dependency issues between main and React exports
- Resolved TypeScript declaration conflicts
- Fixed console warnings replaced with proper logger
- Corrected platform detection without Capacitor dependency

### üìù Notes

- This is a breaking change that requires updating import paths
- Existing v1.x apps will need to install peer dependencies
- In-app notifications now work without any setup
- Better suited for modern, performance-focused applications

## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-01

### Initial Release

- Unified notification API for Web, iOS, and Android
- Support for Firebase and OneSignal providers
- Push notifications, local notifications, and in-app notifications
- React hooks for easy integration
- Full TypeScript support
- Comprehensive documentation
